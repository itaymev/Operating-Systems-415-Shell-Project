# Operating-Systems-415-Shell-Project
Shell program built in Operating Systems class at the University of Oregon

A shell program is a program which hosts the most simple and basic interface that an operating system can offer. There are many commands that a modern shell might have, though for this project we only implemented eight commands, as well as an exit feature. This project was intended for learning and practice purposes only.
