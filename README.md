# Operating-Systems-415-Shell-Project
Shell program built in Operating Systems class at the University of Oregon

A shell program is a program which hosts the most simple and basic interface that an operating system can offer. There are many commands that a modern shell might have, though for this project we only implemented eight commands, as well as an exit feature. In this project we will refer to our product as a "psuedo-shell" and it is because of the limited usage of the program. This project was intended for learning and practice purposes only.

To run this project, ensure all files are in the same directory and run "make ; ./psuedo-shell" or "make ; ./psuedo-shell -f <file_name>" and ensure to clean the directory with "make clean" after usage.

Please read report.pdf for full project details.
